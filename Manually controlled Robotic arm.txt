Project -  MANUALLY CONTROLLED 3 DOF ROBOTIC ARM

The aim of project was to devlop a Pick-n-drop robotic arm that can operate in 3 degree of freedom
For the project i used following devices :
 1. 3 SG90 MICRO SERVO MOTORS
 2. DUAL XY AXIS JOYSTICK MODULE
 3. JUMPER WIRES
 4. ARDUINO UNO R3


3 micro servos are used to control the three avaliable joints in the arm 
two for the xy and yz plane movement and the last one for the claw open-close mechanism with help of metal wires.

joystick module is to control the desired movement 
the x and y axis values are mapped from 0-180 degree to move the servo depending upon the input on joystick
the pressed button is used to control the claw motor\

: Project code is tested on arduino ide

:The chassis for the prototype is designed keeping the centre of mass of all individual parts in mind to avoid the unnecessary bending of any part.
